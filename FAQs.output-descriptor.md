Output Descriptors are human-readable strings that describe Bitcoin output scripts, also known as scriptPubKeys. They include all the information necessary for a wallet or program to track payments and spend from these scripts. 

# Output descriptors are useful for:
1. Wallet Interoperability: They help in generating and tracking addresses consistently across different wallet implementations.
2. Backup and Recovery: They make it easier to recover wallet information by explicitly stating the scripts and keys involved, reducing errors in wallet recovery.
3. Script Complexity: Descriptors can handle various types of scripts, like Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH), Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH), and others, providing clarity on how funds can be spent.

# In the context of Bitcoin script types that output descriptors can handle:

A. Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH):

    **Description**: This is the SegWit version of P2PKH, where the public key hash is stored in the witness part of the transaction. It's more efficient and allows for better scaling due to the use of Segregated Witness (SegWit).

    **Use Case**: Used for single-signature transactions with improved transaction malleability resistance and lower fees.

B. Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH):

    **Description**: Similar to P2SH but for SegWit. The redeem script is placed in the witness data, which makes the transaction more compact and more efficient.

    **Use Case**: Ideal for multi-signature setups or more complex scripts in a SegWit environment.

C. Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR):

    **Description**: Introduced with the Taproot upgrade, P2TR allows for more privacy by making complex scripts look like simple transactions. It uses Schnorr signatures and Merkle trees for script execution.

    **Use Case**: Enhances privacy, reduces transaction size, and allows for more flexible spending conditions under the hood while appearing as simple P2PKH or P2WPKH externally.

D. Multisig:

    **Description**: This isn't a specific script type but can be encapsulated in P2SH, P2WSH, or P2TR scripts. It requires multiple signatures to authorize spending, often used for security in collective funds or cold storage scenarios.

    **Use Case**: Security for organizations or shared wallets where multiple parties must agree to spend funds.

E. Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK):

    **Description**: One of the earliest script types where the transaction output is locked to a single public key. It's less common now due to its lack of privacy and efficiency compared to hash-based addresses.

    **Use Case**: Rarely used in modern contexts but might be seen in very old transactions or for educational purposes.

F. Null Data (OP_RETURN):

    **Description**: Not really for spending but for embedding arbitrary data into the blockchain. This type of script cannot be spent, serving only as a way to store data.

    **Use Case**: Used for timestamping documents, storing small amounts of data, or for various blockchain applications like colored coins.

G. Custom or Complex Scripts:

    **Description**: Bitcoin allows for any valid script to be used, meaning developers can create custom conditions for spending, like time-locks, hash-locks, or combinations of conditions.

    **Use Case**: Used in advanced smart contract scenarios, like HTLCs (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) for cross-chain atomic swaps or Lightning Network channels.

Output descriptors can describe all these script types (and combinations thereof) to provide wallets with the necessary information to generate addresses, track outputs, and construct spending transactions. Each script type has its own set of characteristics regarding privacy, efficiency, and complexity, which can be explicitly detailed through descriptors.

In summary, Miniscript doesn't represent a new type of script but rather enhances how we can describe, compose, and guarantee the behavior of existing script types, especially P2WSH, P2TR, and complex multisig setups. Miniscript compiles down into Bitcoin Script, which can then be used within these script types to lock funds with complex spending conditions. This approach makes it possible to handle intricate smart contract-like scenarios on Bitcoin in a safer, more standardized, and more analyzable manner.
