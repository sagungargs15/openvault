# Job Role: Custody Support Associate

## Job Description
    We are looking for a Custody Support Associate on our Client Services team that has a passion to help our clients by providing exceptional support and service for our suite of bitcoin financial services. Because Unchained is dedicated to helping individuals and businesses hold their own bitcoin private keys, a lot of what we’re building and supporting is novel. In an effort to further expand our availability, we are seeking candidates comfortable working a Sunday through Thursday schedule. Candidates with prior experience in bitcoin self-custody—especially multisig—are preferred, and basic bitcoin technical understanding is necessary.

    The Custody Support Associate role is an integral part of our Client Services team and reports directly to the Vice President of Custody Support. In this role you will manage client support issues, triage requests across multiple channels including email, phone, and video calls, and directly assist with client onboarding through our Concierge onboarding service. This includes, but is not limited to, technical hardware wallet support, account support, and educating clients on the foundations of multisig as well as the overall Unchained product suite. You will work closely with our Sales and Product teams to continuously improve client support by optimizing our protocols, tooling, and support functions.

## What You Will Do

    Act as the first level response for all client service requests. Your thorough understanding of our policies and protocols will enable you to triage and/or escalate service tickets within adherence to organizational SLAs.
    You will be an expert on our platform across internal support tools. This will enable you to handle a wide range of issues that will require you to investigate and troubleshoot in real time. Examples include bitcoin device troubleshooting, pending transactions, and other various bitcoin specific issues related to client accounts.
    You will have the opportunity to help shape and cultivate our team and company culture. You will work closely with peers that share a passion for delivering the best client experience possible. You will have the opportunity to receive continuous education about bitcoin through internal team activities, external events, and discussion.

## What You Can Expect
    First Month: Complete onboarding by learning how to manage our internal tools, demonstrate an understanding of policies and protocols, and understand our products.
    
    Next 3 Months: You will be able to confidently support client issues and questions across phone and email. You’ll develop the ability to articulate client feedback into actionable recommendations for our Sales, Engineering, and Product teams. You will participate in a best-in-class Concierge onboarding training to elevate your level of service to our client base.
    
    Next 8 Months: You will have contributed to building a strong client-first culture in a fast paced and exciting environment. You will support multiple projects varying in scale while still demonstrating excellent client support across all channels which will be measured by internal KPIs.
