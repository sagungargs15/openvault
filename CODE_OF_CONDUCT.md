# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and participants in our OpenVault Bitcoin project. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and serves as a guide for resolving conflicts.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Enforcement Procedures

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at [maintainers@example.com](mailto:maintainers@example.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary or permanent ban from the project.
